## Calculating Zone-based Cancer Rates

The process document `~ZoneRateCalc Process_[Date].docx` describes how to calculate zoned-based cancer incidence rates.  It assumes that you have access to individual-level cancer data geocoded to census tracts in SEERStat and that these data are linked with the tract-level population denominators needed for calculating age-adjusted rates.  

We also assume you have access to SAS.  This process is designed to produce SEERStat matrix files that can be used to generate the cancer rate tables needed for the web-based tool for cancer reporting by zones.  If desired, Westat can assist with this processing once any necessary data usage agreements are in place.
